# :sunny: Sunny Makes Promises :sunny:
Hey, I'm Sunny!!! I'm a junior at Rutgers majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in a lot of stuff from web design, software design, data analysis, video game development, machine learning, and *tons* of other stuff I probably forgot about. I do a lot of projects but I rarely ever finish them so I want to hold myself accountable with a public github account lmao :sob:
