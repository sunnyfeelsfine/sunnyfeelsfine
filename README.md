# :sunny: Sunny Makes Promises :sunny:
Hey, I'm Sunny!!! I'm a junior at Rutgers majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in a lot of stuff from web design, software design, data analysis, video game development, machine learning, and *tons* of other stuff I probably forgot about. This account will probably just be used to keep all my random personal projects about stuff that interests me lmao :sob:
