# sunny makes promises
hiiii, i'm sunny :sunny:!!! i'm a junior at rutgers majoring in computer science. i'm interested in a lot of stuff like web design, software design, data analysis, video game development, machine learning, and *tons* of other stuff I probably forgot about. I do a lot of projects but I rarely ever finish them so I want to hold myself accountable with a public github account lmao :sob:
